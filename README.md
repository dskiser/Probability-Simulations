# Probability Simulations

Sometimes it is easier to run a simulation to determine the probability of an event than it is to calculate the probability using the laws of probability.  Here I have used python  and R scripts to create simulations.

Some of the problems come from homework for "Introduction to Probability." Others were written to satisfy personal curiosity.
